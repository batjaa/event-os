# Event OS

**The event management platform that Cvent charges $20K/year for, except you can clone it and run it in 5 minutes.**

We run Dev Summit in Mongolia. Every year it's the same story: 47 spreadsheets, 200 Telegram messages, one person who "definitely sent that invoice" (they didn't), and a check-in line that makes people question their life choices.

Cvent wants $20K/year + $10K implementation. Bizzabo won't even show you pricing without a sales call. Sessionize handles CFPs but not payments. Eventbrite handles tickets but not schedules. So you end up with 6 tools duct-taped together and a spreadsheet that is technically load-bearing.

Event OS replaces all of that. One app. Speakers, schedule, sponsors, booths, volunteers, media partners, marketing, check-in — plus post-confirmation checklists, a stakeholder portal, and an in-app notification system. Multi-event support so next year you don't start from zero.

Built by a small team for small teams. If you're running a tech conference with spreadsheets and prayers, this is for you.

## The agent-first difference

Most event tools give you 14 forms and say "type everything in manually." Event OS gives you a chat agent. Type naturally — "add speaker Sarah from Google, keynote on AI" — and the agent creates the record. Ask "how many sponsors are confirmed?" and it queries the database. Paste a spreadsheet and it bulk-imports everything.

The agent understands English, Mongolian (Cyrillic), and transliterated Mongolian. It enforces the same RBAC as the web UI — a coordinator can't delete records via chat any more than they can via the dashboard.

**Cmd+K** opens the agent from anywhere.

Supports **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (free tier, default), **xAI**, **z.ai**, **Ollama** (local), or add your own by implementing one interface.

## What's in the box

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent Intelligence** | Natural language CRUD — create, update, search, count any entity type. Bulk import from CSV/chat logs. RBAC-enforced, prompt injection hardened, multilingual. Cmd+K from anywhere. |
| **Speaker Pipeline** | CFP form → review → accept/reject. Pipeline table with inline stage/source/assignee editing. |
| **Sponsor Pipeline** | Outreach to confirmation. Same unified pipeline model as speakers. |
| **Venue Pipeline** | Multiple venue candidates, negotiations, pricing, finalization. |
| **Booth Management** | Inventory, reservations, company contacts, sponsor linking. |
| **Volunteer Management** | Applications, assignments, pipeline tracking. |
| **Media Partners** | TV/press/podcast pipeline with contact management. |
| **Outreach CRM** | Proactive sourcing for all entity types. Follow-up tracking. |
| **Agenda Builder** | Multi-track schedule, conflict detection (speaker double-booked? room collision?), draft/publish toggle. |
| **Marketing Calendar** | Month-view content calendar. Click a day to add an item. Assign to team members. Platform tags (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Telegram). |
| **Task Board** | Kanban drag-and-drop (To Do → In Progress → Blocked → Done). Click cards for detail drawer with inline comments. Create/rename/delete teams. |
| **Invitations** | Speaker +1s, organizer +1s, student passes. Configurable allocations. QR codes. |
| **QR Check-in** | Scanner mode + dashboard mode with live stats. |
| **Post-Confirmation Checklists** | When an entity is confirmed, auto-generate checklist items from templates (upload photo, submit slides, confirm travel). Track progress per entity. Admins configure templates in Settings. |
| **Stakeholder Portal** | Confirmed speakers/sponsors get a login to self-service their checklist items — upload photos, submit bios, confirm travel. Organizers see submissions and approve/reject. |
| **RBAC & Team Management** | 6 roles (owner → admin → organizer → coordinator → viewer → stakeholder). Team-scoped permissions — teams own entity types. Confirmed entities protected from non-admin deletion. Same rules enforced in web UI and agent. |
| **Notifications** | In-app notifications for assignments, stage changes, checklist submissions, comments. Bell icon with unread badge. Mark read, bulk delete. |
| **Settings** | Tabbed: Event details, Team management (invite/roles), Checklist templates (per entity type), Telegram connection (placeholder). |
| **Public Agenda** | Attendee-facing schedule with day/track filters. |
| **CFP Form** | Public speaker application form. |

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarbayar/event-os.git
cd event-os
npm install
```

### 2. Set up the database

**Option A: SQLite** (zero-install, fastest way to start)

No setup needed — just set one environment variable and go.

**Option B: Local PostgreSQL**

```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16
createdb event_os
```

**Option C: Supabase** (cloud, free tier)

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to **Settings → Database** and copy the connection string

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```bash
# Pick one:
# --- SQLite (no database server needed) ---
DB_DIALECT="sqlite"
AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# --- PostgreSQL ---
# DB_DIALECT="postgresql"
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://youruser@localhost:5432/event_os"
# AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# Optional — for the agent chat panel
LLM_PROVIDER="gemini"          # gemini | xai | zai | ollama
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"      # free at ai.google.dev
```

### 4. Push schema and seed

```bash
# SQLite
DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx drizzle-kit push --config=drizzle.config.sqlite.ts
DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx tsx src/db/seed.ts

# PostgreSQL
npx drizzle-kit push
npx tsx src/db/seed.ts
```

### 5. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `localhost:3000`. Log in with `admin@devsummit.mn` / `admin123`.

**All seeded users** (password: `admin123`):

| Name | Email | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Amarbayar | admin@devsummit.mn | Owner |
| Tuvshin | tuvshin@devsummit.mn | Organizer |
| Oyungerel | oyungerel@devsummit.mn | Organizer |
| Bat-Erdene | baterdene@devsummit.mn | Coordinator |
| Sarnai | sarnai@devsummit.mn | Coordinator |

### Database commands

| Task | PostgreSQL | SQLite |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Push schema | `npx drizzle-kit push` | `DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx drizzle-kit push --config=drizzle.config.sqlite.ts` |
| Seed data | `npx tsx src/db/seed.ts` | `DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx tsx src/db/seed.ts` |
| Browse DB | `npx drizzle-kit studio` | `DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx drizzle-kit studio --config=drizzle.config.sqlite.ts` |
| Reset DB | `psql -d event_os -c "DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE; CREATE SCHEMA public;"` then push + seed | Delete `local.db` then push + seed |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | What it is |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `DB_DIALECT` | No | `postgresql` (default) or `sqlite` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PG only | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `SQLITE_PATH` | No | SQLite file path (default: `local.db`) |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | Random string — `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | No | `http://localhost:3000` for dev (auto-detected) |
| `SERVICE_TOKEN` | No | Random token for API service auth |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | No | `gemini` (default), `xai`, `zai`, or `ollama` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | No | Free at [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev) |
| `XAI_API_KEY` | No | xAI API key |
| `ZAI_API_KEY` | No | z.ai (ZhipuAI) API key |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | No | Ollama URL (default: `localhost:11434`) |
| `QUEUE_ENABLED` | No | `true` to route emails/notifications through the job queue |
| `MAIL_DRIVER` | No | `log` (default), `mailgun`, or `postmark` |
| `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | No | Sender email (default: `noreply@example.com`) |
| `MAIL_FROM_NAME` | No | Sender name (default: `Event OS`) |
| `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN` | Postmark only | Postmark API token |
| `MAILGUN_API_KEY` | Mailgun only | Mailgun API key |
| `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` | Mailgun only | Mailgun sending domain |

## Job Queue & Background Workers

Email sending and notifications are processed in the background via a database-backed job queue. When `QUEUE_ENABLED=true`, `mail()` and `notify()` return immediately — the actual work happens in a separate worker process with retry and exponential backoff.

### Local development

Run the worker alongside your dev server in a second terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Next.js dev server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — Queue worker
QUEUE_ENABLED=true DB_DIALECT=sqlite npm run queue:work
```

Without the worker running, emails and notifications fall back to synchronous inline processing (no `QUEUE_ENABLED` needed).

### How it works

```
API route → mail() / notify() → INSERT into jobs table → return immediately
                                        ↓
Queue worker (polls) → claim job → execute handler → complete / retry / fail
```

- **Adaptive polling:** 1s → 2s → 4s → ... → 10s cap when idle, resets to 1s on job found
- **Retry with backoff:** configurable per job (emails: 3 attempts, 15s base backoff)
- **Timeout:** per-job AbortController timeout (emails: 30s, notifications: 10s)
- **Failed jobs:** after max retries, moved to `failed_jobs` table for inspection
- **Graceful shutdown:** SIGTERM/SIGINT finishes the current job before exiting
- **Stale recovery:** processing jobs stuck >5 minutes are automatically released

### Worker commands

```bash
npm run queue:work                              # process high + default queues
npm run queue:work -- --queues=high,default     # explicit queue list
npm run queue:work -- --queues=high             # only high-priority queue
```

### Production deployment

The worker is a long-running Node.js process. How you run it depends on your deployment:

**Forge (DigitalOcean/AWS)**

Add a Forge daemon — it auto-restarts on crash, same as Laravel's queue worker:

1. Go to your Forge site → **Daemons**
2. Command: `node_modules/.bin/tsx scripts/queue-worker.ts`
3. Directory: `/home/forge/your-site/current`
4. Set environment variables (same as your `.env` — `QUEUE_ENABLED`, `MAIL_DRIVER`, `POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN`, etc.)

**Docker / docker-compose**

Add a second service that runs the same image with a different entrypoint:

```yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: npm start
    env_file: .env

  worker:
    build: .
    command: npx tsx scripts/queue-worker.ts
    env_file: .env
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**systemd**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Event OS Queue Worker
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=deploy
WorkingDirectory=/opt/event-os
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npx tsx scripts/queue-worker.ts
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
EnvironmentFile=/opt/event-os/.env

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Vercel / serverless**

Long-running workers can't run on serverless platforms. Options:
- Use an external cron service (e.g., [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org)) to hit an API route that processes a batch of jobs
- Run the worker on a separate $5/mo VPS (DigitalOcean, Hetzner)
- Skip the queue — without `QUEUE_ENABLED=true`, emails send synchronously inline

### Current job types

| Job | Queue | Timeout | Retries | Backoff |
|-----|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| `send-email` | default | 30s | 3 | 15s exponential |
| `send-notification` | default | 10s | 3 | 5s exponential |

## Testing

Tests run against SQLite by default — no PostgreSQL or external services needed.

### Quick start

```bash
# Set up SQLite test database
DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx drizzle-kit push --config=drizzle.config.sqlite.ts
DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx tsx src/db/seed.ts

# Run unit + integration tests (no server needed)
DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx vitest run tests/unit tests/integration

# Run all tests including e2e (needs running server)
DB_DIALECT=sqlite AUTH_SECRET=test-secret SERVICE_TOKEN=test-token npm run dev &
DB_DIALECT=sqlite SERVICE_TOKEN=test-token npx vitest run

# Watch mode
DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx vitest
```

### Test structure

Tests are organized by scope:

```
tests/
  unit/           # No DB, no server — pure logic
    schema-sync   # PG ↔ SQLite schema parity
    rbac          # Permission logic
  integration/    # Needs seeded DB — tests functions directly
    checklist     # Checklist lifecycle (generate, archive, restore)
    agent-*       # Agent dispatcher, handlers, input guards, LLM security
  e2e/            # Needs running server — tests HTTP API
    pipeline      # CRUD lifecycle for all entity types
    security      # Auth enforcement, bcrypt, CSO audit regressions
```

### LLM-dependent tests

Some agent tests call the real Gemini API. They auto-skip when no API key is set. To run them locally:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx vitest run tests/integration
```

### CI (GitHub Actions)

Tests run automatically on push to `main` and on pull requests. The workflow uses SQLite so no database service is needed.

**Two jobs:**
- **Unit & Integration** — fast (~2s), runs `tests/unit` + `tests/integration`
- **E2E** — builds the app, starts the production server, runs `tests/e2e`

**To enable LLM tests in CI**, add your Gemini API key as a repository secret:

```bash
# Via GitHub CLI
gh secret set GEMINI_API_KEY --repo your-org/event-os

# Or go to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
# Name: GEMINI_API_KEY
# Value: your-gemini-api-key
```

Without the secret, LLM tests are skipped — all other tests still run and pass.

## Security

- **RBAC:** 6 roles with team-scoped permissions. Same rules enforced on web UI and agent.
- **Org isolation:** Every mutation WHERE clause includes `organizationId`. Cross-org access blocked.
- **Stage protection:** Confirmed entities can't be deleted by non-admins (web UI + agent).
- **Agent hardening:** Prompt injection defense (multilingual), bulk operation blocking, sensitive field stripping, @mention gating for group chats.
- **Password hashing:** bcrypt (12 rounds). Pre-commit hook scans for leaked credentials.
- **205 automated tests** covering RBAC, agent CRUD, prompt injection, checklist lifecycle, security regressions.

Never commit `.env.local`. The `.env.example` file has safe placeholders only.

## Key Design Decisions

**Why both PostgreSQL and SQLite?** PostgreSQL for production and teams. SQLite for contributors who want to clone and run in under a minute with zero infrastructure. Both schemas are kept in sync by an automated test. SQLite is single-writer, so it's not suitable for high-concurrency production — use Postgres there.

**Why a unified pipeline model?** Every entity type (speaker, sponsor, venue, booth, volunteer, media) uses the same `source` (intake/outreach/sponsored) + `stage` (lead/engaged/confirmed/declined) columns. One reusable `PipelineTable` component, one `requirePermission` middleware, one mental model.

**Why bcrypt, not Argon2?** bcrypt is well-tested, has zero native dependencies (bcryptjs is pure JS), and is sufficient for our threat model. Argon2 would require native compilation which breaks some deployment targets.

**Why role-based access control?** 6 roles with team-scoped permissions. Teams own entity types — an organizer on the "Program" team can edit speakers but not sponsors. Same rules apply on every surface: web UI, API, and agent chat.

**Why checklist auto-generation on confirm?** The moment an entity is confirmed, the work begins — collect their photo, get their slides, confirm travel. Auto-generating checklist items from templates means organizers never forget a step.

**Why no system alerts?** `window.confirm()` and `window.alert()` break the visual theme, feel cheap, and can't be styled. Every confirmation uses the themed `ConfirmDialog` component.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions and the secret safety checklist.

**When building features:**
- Every DB mutation WHERE clause must include `organizationId`
- Every new API route must use `requirePermission()`
- Never use `window.confirm()`, `window.alert()`, or `window.prompt()` — use `useConfirm()` hook
- If you build create, also build edit, delete, and error handling
- Run `npx vitest run` before pushing — all tests must pass
