# Event OS

**The event management platform that Cvent charges $20K/year for, except you can clone it and run it in 5 minutes.**

We run Dev Summit in Mongolia. Every year it's the same story: 47 spreadsheets, 200 Telegram messages, one person who "definitely sent that invoice" (they didn't), and a check-in line that makes people question their life choices.

Cvent wants $20K/year + $10K implementation. Bizzabo won't even show you pricing without a sales call. Sessionize handles CFPs but not payments. Eventbrite handles tickets but not schedules. So you end up with 6 tools duct-taped together and a spreadsheet that is technically load-bearing.

Event OS replaces all of that. One app. Speakers, schedule, sponsors, booths, volunteers, media partners, marketing, check-in. Multi-event support so next year you don't start from zero.

Built by a 3-person team for 3-person teams. If you're running a tech conference with spreadsheets and prayers, this is for you. If you're a founder who can vibe-code, fork it and make it yours in an afternoon.

## The agent-first difference

Most event tools give you 14 forms and say "type everything in manually." Event OS gives you a chat panel. Paste a Viber conversation, drop a spreadsheet, type "just talked to Golomt Bank, they want Gold sponsorship" — the agent figures out what type of entity it is (speaker? sponsor? venue? volunteer?), extracts structured data, asks about anything missing, and creates the records. You confirm with one click.

**Cmd+K** opens the agent from anywhere. The 14 entity pages still exist — but they're views you glance at, not forms you type into.

Supports multiple LLM providers: **Gemini** (free tier, default), **Ollama/Qwen** (local, free), or add your own by implementing one interface.

## What's in the box

| Module | What it does | What you'd otherwise use |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| **Agent Chat Panel** | Paste anything — CSV, chat logs, phone notes. Agent classifies, extracts, creates records. Cmd+K from anywhere. | Your brain + copy-paste + 14 different forms |
| **Agenda Builder** | Multi-track schedule editor, conflict detection (speaker double-booked? room collision? 5-minute gap between talks?), draft/publish toggle | Google Sheets + hope |
| **Speaker Pipeline** | CFP form, review scores, accept/reject/waitlist, application status tracking | Google Forms + another spreadsheet |
| **Sponsor Pipeline** | Proposal to payment tracking | Email threads + memory |
| **Venue Pipeline** | Venue candidates, negotiations, pricing, pros/cons, team assignment, finalization | "I think we decided on Chinggis Khaan?" |
| **Booth Management** | Inventory grid, reservations, equipment lists, sponsor linking | A floor plan PDF and sticky notes |
| **Volunteer Management** | Applications, shift assignments, t-shirt sizes | A WhatsApp group |
| **Outreach CRM** | Proactive sourcing for speakers, sponsors, booths, volunteers, media. Pipeline funnel. Follow-up tracking. | A spreadsheet someone forgot to update |
| **Media Partners** | TV/press/podcast pipeline with deliverables tracking | "I think Bayaraa said they'd cover it?" |
| **Marketing Planner** | Campaign calendar, speaker announcements, schedule/publish per platform | Posting manually and forgetting LinkedIn |
| **Invitations** | Special guests, speaker +1s, organizer +1s, student passes. Configurable allocations. QR codes for all. | An email chain and a prayer |
| **Task Management** | Teams (Program, Logistics, Sponsors...), kanban board + list view, due dates, priority, linked entities | Trello that nobody checks |
| **QR Check-in** | Scanner mode + dashboard mode, offline support, works when the venue WiFi inevitably dies | Paper lists and highlighters |
| **Public Agenda** | Attendee-facing schedule with day/track filters | A PDF that's outdated by the time you export it |
| **CFP Form** | Public speaker application with validation | Google Forms (again) |

## Architecture

The system is two halves: a web app for visual work (building schedules, managing pipelines) and a Telegram agent for quick decisions (approve this speaker? chase that invoice?). Both read/write the same database.

## Tech Stack

Not trying to be clever here. Boring tech that works.

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | Server components, API routes, one deploy target |
| Language | TypeScript | Catch bugs before your users do |
| Styling | Tailwind + shadcn/ui | Fast, accessible components out of the box |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Supabase | Free tier is generous, comes with storage |
| ORM | Drizzle | Type-safe, no magic, SQL when you need it |
| Auth | NextAuth.js | Credentials + service token for the agent |
| Agent LLM | Gemini (default), Ollama/Qwen (local) | Abstracted — add providers with one interface |
| Icons | Lucide React | Consistent, tree-shakeable |

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarbayar/event-os.git
cd event-os
npm install
```

### 2. Set up Supabase

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to **Settings → Database** and copy the connection string (URI format)

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your values — at minimum `DATABASE_URL` and `AUTH_SECRET`:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres.[your-project-ref]:[password]@aws-0-[region].pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres"
AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

### 4. Push schema and seed

```bash
# Create all tables in your Supabase database
npx drizzle-kit push

# Populate with sample data (Dev Summit 2026 — org, speakers, sessions, sponsors, attendees, etc.)
node -r dotenv/config node_modules/.bin/tsx src/db/seed.ts
```

### 5. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `localhost:3000`. Log in with `admin@devsummit.mn` / `admin123` (or any of the 5 seeded users).

### Database commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Push schema changes to DB | `npx drizzle-kit push` |
| Seed with fixture data | `node -r dotenv/config node_modules/.bin/tsx src/db/seed.ts` |
| Browse DB in browser | `npx drizzle-kit studio` |

> **Note:** `drizzle-kit push` syncs your schema to the database without migration files — it compares `src/db/schema.ts` against the live DB and applies the diff. Good for development; for production, consider using `drizzle-kit generate` + `drizzle-kit migrate` for versioned migrations.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | What it is |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Supabase PostgreSQL connection string |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Yes | Any random string — `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Yes | `http://localhost:3000` for dev, your domain for prod |
| `SERVICE_TOKEN` | No | Random token for Telegram agent API auth |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | No | `gemini` (default), `xai`, or `ollama` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | No | Free at [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev) — needed if using the agent chat panel |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | No | Ollama URL if using local model (default: `localhost:11434`) |

### Deploy

```bash
# Vercel (web app)
vercel --prod

# The agent runs on Railway or Fly.io as a long-running Node service
```

## Key Design Decisions

**Why a PostgreSQL event queue instead of webhooks?** If the agent is down when a speaker applies, a webhook is lost forever. A queue table means events wait until the agent picks them up. Boring? Yes. Loses data? No.

**Why version counters instead of timestamps for optimistic locking?** Two writes in the same millisecond both succeed with timestamp-based locking. A monotonic integer doesn't have that problem.

**Why first-check-in-wins for offline sync?** Check-in is monotonic — once someone is checked in, they're checked in. Last-write-wins could accidentally un-check-in someone. First-check-in-wins can't.

**Why not just build a Telegram bot without the web app?** You can't build a drag-and-drop schedule editor in a chat message. Some workflows need visual UI. Some need quick chat decisions. The hybrid lets organizers pick.

## For Vibe Coders

This entire codebase was built in one session with AI. Every page follows the same pattern:

1. Stat cards at the top (2-col mobile, 4-col desktop)
2. Filter buttons below
3. Entity cards with status badges and actions
4. Empty states with helpful CTAs

Want to add a new entity type (e.g., "Hackathon Teams")? Copy `src/app/(dashboard)/volunteers/page.tsx`, change the fields, add a table to `src/db/schema.ts`, done. The pattern is the product.

## Security

This is a **public repository**. A pre-commit hook scans every commit for API keys, tokens, and credentials. See `.githooks/pre-commit`.

Never commit `.env.local`. The `.env.example` file has safe placeholders only.
