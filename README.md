# Event OS

**The event management platform that Cvent charges $20K/year for, except you can clone it and run it in 5 minutes.**

We run Dev Summit in Mongolia. Every year it's the same story: 47 spreadsheets, 200 Telegram messages, one person who "definitely sent that invoice" (they didn't), and a check-in line that makes people question their life choices.

Cvent wants $20K/year + $10K implementation. Bizzabo won't even show you pricing without a sales call. Sessionize handles CFPs but not payments. Eventbrite handles tickets but not schedules. So you end up with 6 tools duct-taped together and a spreadsheet that is technically load-bearing.

Event OS replaces all of that. One app. Speakers, schedule, sponsors, booths, volunteers, media partners, marketing, check-in — plus post-confirmation checklists, a stakeholder portal, and an in-app notification system. Multi-event support so next year you don't start from zero.

Built by a small team for small teams. If you're running a tech conference with spreadsheets and prayers, this is for you.

## The agent-first difference

Most event tools give you 14 forms and say "type everything in manually." Event OS gives you a chat agent. Type naturally — "add speaker Sarah from Google, keynote on AI" — and the agent creates the record. Ask "how many sponsors are confirmed?" and it queries the database. Paste a spreadsheet and it bulk-imports everything.

The agent understands English, Mongolian (Cyrillic), and transliterated Mongolian. It enforces the same RBAC as the web UI — a coordinator can't delete records via chat any more than they can via the dashboard.

**Cmd+K** opens the agent from anywhere.

Supports **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (free tier, default), **xAI**, **z.ai**, **Ollama** (local), or add your own by implementing one interface.

## What's in the box

| Module | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent Intelligence** | Natural language CRUD — create, update, search, count any entity type. Bulk import from CSV/chat logs. RBAC-enforced, prompt injection hardened, multilingual. Cmd+K from anywhere. |
| **Speaker Pipeline** | CFP form → review → accept/reject. Pipeline table with inline stage/source/assignee editing. |
| **Sponsor Pipeline** | Outreach to confirmation. Same unified pipeline model as speakers. |
| **Venue Pipeline** | Multiple venue candidates, negotiations, pricing, finalization. |
| **Booth Management** | Inventory, reservations, company contacts, sponsor linking. |
| **Volunteer Management** | Applications, assignments, pipeline tracking. |
| **Media Partners** | TV/press/podcast pipeline with contact management. |
| **Outreach CRM** | Proactive sourcing for all entity types. Follow-up tracking. |
| **Agenda Builder** | Multi-track schedule, conflict detection (speaker double-booked? room collision?), draft/publish toggle. |
| **Marketing Calendar** | Month-view content calendar. Click a day to add an item. Assign to team members. Platform tags (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Telegram). |
| **Task Board** | Kanban drag-and-drop (To Do → In Progress → Blocked → Done). Click cards for detail drawer with inline comments. Create/rename/delete teams. |
| **Invitations** | Speaker +1s, organizer +1s, student passes. Configurable allocations. QR codes. |
| **QR Check-in** | Scanner mode + dashboard mode with live stats. |
| **Post-Confirmation Checklists** | When an entity is confirmed, auto-generate checklist items from templates (upload photo, submit slides, confirm travel). Track progress per entity. Admins configure templates in Settings. |
| **Stakeholder Portal** | Confirmed speakers/sponsors get a login to self-service their checklist items — upload photos, submit bios, confirm travel. Organizers see submissions and approve/reject. |
| **RBAC & Team Management** | 6 roles (owner → admin → organizer → coordinator → viewer → stakeholder). Team-scoped permissions — teams own entity types. Confirmed entities protected from non-admin deletion. Same rules enforced in web UI and agent. |
| **Notifications** | In-app notifications for assignments, stage changes, checklist submissions, comments. Bell icon with unread badge. Mark read, bulk delete. |
| **Settings** | Tabbed: Event details, Team management (invite/roles), Checklist templates (per entity type), Telegram connection (placeholder). |
| **Public Agenda** | Attendee-facing schedule with day/track filters. |
| **CFP Form** | Public speaker application form. |

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amarbayar/event-os.git
cd event-os
npm install
```

### 2. Set up the database

**Option A: SQLite** (zero-install, fastest way to start)

No setup needed — just set one environment variable and go.

**Option B: Local PostgreSQL**

```bash
# macOS
brew install postgresql@16
brew services start postgresql@16
createdb event_os
```

**Option C: Supabase** (cloud, free tier)

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to **Settings → Database** and copy the connection string

### 3. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```bash
# Pick one:
# --- SQLite (no database server needed) ---
DB_DIALECT="sqlite"
AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# --- PostgreSQL ---
# DB_DIALECT="postgresql"
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://youruser@localhost:5432/event_os"
# AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# Optional — for the agent chat panel
LLM_PROVIDER="gemini"          # gemini | xai | zai | ollama
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"      # free at ai.google.dev
```

### 4. Push schema and seed

```bash
# SQLite
DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx drizzle-kit push --config=drizzle.config.sqlite.ts
DB_DIALECT=sqlite npx tsx src/db/seed.ts

# PostgreSQL
npx drizzle-kit push
npx tsx src/db/seed.ts
```

### 5. Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `localhost:3000`. Log in with `admin@devsummit.mn` / `admin123`.

**All seeded users** (password: `admin123`):

| Name | Email | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Amarbayar | admin@devsummit.mn | Owner |
| Tuvshin | tuvshin@devsummit.mn | Organizer |
| Oyungerel | oyungerel@devsummit.mn | Organizer |
| Bat-Erdene | baterdene@devsummit.mn | Coordinator |
| Sarnai | sarnai@devsummit.mn | Coordinator |

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npx vitest run

# Run a specific test file
npx vitest run tests/schema-sync.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npx vitest
```

Tests that hit the database (RBAC, checklist, security, pipeline) require a running PostgreSQL with seeded data. The schema sync test runs without any database.

| Suite | What it covers | DB required |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| `schema-sync` | PG ↔ SQLite schema parity (tables + columns) | No |
| `rbac` | Role-based access control on all API routes | Yes (PG) |
| `checklist` | Auto-generate, archive, restore checklist items | Yes (PG) |
| `security` | CSO audit regression tests | Yes (PG) |
| `pipeline` | Stage transitions, source tracking | Yes (PG) |
| `agent-*` | Agent CRUD, prompt injection, field stripping | Yes (PG) |

## Security

- **RBAC:** 6 roles with team-scoped permissions. Same rules enforced on web UI and agent.
- **Org isolation:** Every mutation WHERE clause includes `organizationId`. Cross-org access blocked.
- **Stage protection:** Confirmed entities can't be deleted by non-admins (web UI + agent).
- **Agent hardening:** Prompt injection defense (multilingual), bulk operation blocking, sensitive field stripping, @mention gating for group chats.
- **Password hashing:** bcrypt (12 rounds). Pre-commit hook scans for leaked credentials.
- **205 automated tests** covering RBAC, agent CRUD, prompt injection, checklist lifecycle, security regressions.

Never commit `.env.local`. The `.env.example` file has safe placeholders only.

## Key Design Decisions

**Why both PostgreSQL and SQLite?** PostgreSQL for production and teams. SQLite for contributors who want to clone and run in under a minute with zero infrastructure. Both schemas are kept in sync by an automated test. SQLite is single-writer, so it's not suitable for high-concurrency production — use Postgres there.

**Why a unified pipeline model?** Every entity type (speaker, sponsor, venue, booth, volunteer, media) uses the same `source` (intake/outreach/sponsored) + `stage` (lead/engaged/confirmed/declined) columns. One reusable `PipelineTable` component, one `requirePermission` middleware, one mental model.

**Why bcrypt, not Argon2?** bcrypt is well-tested, has zero native dependencies (bcryptjs is pure JS), and is sufficient for our threat model. Argon2 would require native compilation which breaks some deployment targets.

**Why role-based access control?** 6 roles with team-scoped permissions. Teams own entity types — an organizer on the "Program" team can edit speakers but not sponsors. Same rules apply on every surface: web UI, API, and agent chat.

**Why checklist auto-generation on confirm?** The moment an entity is confirmed, the work begins — collect their photo, get their slides, confirm travel. Auto-generating checklist items from templates means organizers never forget a step.

**Why no system alerts?** `window.confirm()` and `window.alert()` break the visual theme, feel cheap, and can't be styled. Every confirmation uses the themed `ConfirmDialog` component.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. Read `CLAUDE.md` for project conventions and the secret safety checklist.

**When building features:**
- Every DB mutation WHERE clause must include `organizationId`
- Every new API route must use `requirePermission()`
- Never use `window.confirm()`, `window.alert()`, or `window.prompt()` — use `useConfirm()` hook
- If you build create, also build edit, delete, and error handling
- Run `npx vitest run` before pushing — all tests must pass
